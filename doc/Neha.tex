\section{Neha's writing goes here}

\textcolor{red}{Please give appropriate name of the Section and please follow the same details as we gave in MP1. I would suggest you to write in the latex format as that will help you later as well. A good source of latex info is available at the following link: \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Introduction}. Do not worry about the latex compilation error as you may not be able to compile it at your end.}
